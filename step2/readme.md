# Discovering the most essential protein coding biomarker by multiple **machine learning algorithms** 

 This code includes a comparison of various machine learning algorithms include Optimized-XGBoost ,SVM,RF and decision tree. The area under the computing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and accuracy were calculated to estimate the different machine learning models. 
Then, the specific hyperparameters  and other information can be found in this code.
